# SimpleFlyPlugin

This is an example fly plugin. So you can use in your servers.

This plugin provide players to fly, changing fly speed and checking who are able to fly.

I tested on 1.20.6 version. I don't know other versions.

Plugin have a bug. When server restarts or stop, plugin forgets who able to fly. So players will drop, when they flying. I will fix soon.

# Commands

/fly or /fly <username> Enables or disables players fly feature.

/flyspeed <value> or /flyspeed <value> <username> Changes players fly speed.

/lfly Prints a list who are able to fly.

To use this commands, you need to be server operator.
